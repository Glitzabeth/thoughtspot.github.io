If you find that the charts and tables built on a worksheet contain a large
number of null values (which display as `{blank}` in the web browser), you can
fix this by changing the [inclusion rule](about-inclusion-rule.html#) for the
worksheet.

To change the inclusion or join rule of a worksheet:

1. Click on the **DATA** icon on the top navigation bar and then on **Worksheets**.

2. Click on the name of the worksheet you want to edit from the list.
3. Click the **Edit** button in the upper right hand side of the screen.
4. Click on the **Choose Sources** link.

5. Choose the [inclusion rule](about-inclusion-rule.html#) and/or the [worksheet join rule](progressive-joins.html#).
