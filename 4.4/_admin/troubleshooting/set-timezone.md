ThoughtSpot comes configured with the timezone where it is to be installed. Data
is imported based on the timezone of the node from which `tsload` or `tql` is run.

If you need to change the timezone, for example when moving a ThoughtSpot
appliance to another data center [contact ThoughtSpot Support]({{ site.baseurl
}}/admin/misc/contact.html#), and they will change the timezone for you.

Note that if the timezone was not set correctly when shipped, it may be
necessary to have ThoughtSpot Support reset it. This can be true even if the
file `/etc/timezone` lists the correct timezone. Sometimes the timezone that is
listed is not the active timezone and it needs to be reset.
