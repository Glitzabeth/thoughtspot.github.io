After you upload a CSV file, it is available as a table in ThoughtSpot. The
**Profile** tab appears after you have selected a specific table from **DATA**.

The data profile includes null values, min, max, average, and sum information
for each table column. This **Profile** view should help you get a better sense
of whatâ€™s there before searching on the data.
