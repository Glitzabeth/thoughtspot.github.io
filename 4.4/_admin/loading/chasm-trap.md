In a complex schema, you may have a fact table with no relationship to another
fact table, except that each contains a foreign key to a shared dimension table.
This is known as a chasm trap, and ThoughtSpot can handle it!

## Understand how chasm traps occur

A fact table, just as it sounds, stores facts about your business. If you are
selling applies, the sales fact table has facts about these apples.

| SaleID  | AppleTypeID  | StoreID  |  Units Sold |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4  |  55 |   2|  12 |
| 8 |  34 |  33 |  3 |
| 10  | 09  |  09 | 1  |

Dimension tables describe the attributes that are interesting to analyze. For
example, the apple table might look like this.

| AppleTypeID  | Color  | Name  | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| 55  |  Red |   Red Delicious |  Snack |
| 34 |  Green |  Granny Smith |  Cooking |
| 09  | Yellow  |  Golden  | Snack  |

As you can imagine, in a business you might have several fact tables that access
dimension tables. So, an apple business may record waste as well as sales.

| TimeID  | AppleTypeID  | StoreID  |  Units Wasted |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4  |  55 |   2|  2 |
| 8 |  34 |  33 |  43 |
| 10  | 09  |  09 | 11  |

Both the sales and waste tables are facts that reference the apple dimension table.

A chasm trap in a data schema can introduce problems of over counting if you
join the two fact tables through their shared dimension table. This diagram
shows a typical complex schema with several tables that are related over a chasm
trap:

Examples of use cases where a chasm trap could occur when attribution analysis
compare campaign data with purchase data, where all they have in common is that
both contain a customer identifier that is a foreign key to a customer dimension
table. Chasm traps also occur, for example, in cost of sales analysis when
wholesale orders data is only related to the retail sales data through a shared
products dimension table.

In many databases, joining tables across a chasm trap creates a _Cartesian
product_ or _cross join_. That is each row from the first fact table is joined to
each row from the second table. A Cartesian product causes over counting when
computing counts and aggregates. ThoughtSpot protects you from this kind of over
counting.

There are still just a few things to look out for when using a schema that contains chasm traps:

-   The tables should be joined to the dimension table via an equi-join (i.e. a primary key/foreign key relationship). They cannot be joined using a range of values.
-   Review the column setting called [Attribution Dimension]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/data-modeling/attributable-dimension.html#). You may need to change this setting if some of the columns in the shared dimension table should not be used for attribution when combining fact tables.
-   Tables that will be joined across a chasm trap do not need to be co-sharded. They will be joined appropriately automatically in the most efficient way.

## Chasm trap limitations

If your database schema contains any chasm traps, you may encounter these limitations.

### Operations

The following limitations on chasm trap schemas will produce a red bar error in the ThoughtSpot application:

-   **Show underlying data** does not work for chasm trap searches, whether the search is on a worksheet containing a chasm trap or on base tables that are related over a chasm trap.
-   When using the ThoughtSpot APIs, you cannot pass filter values via the URL if the relevant searches occur on a worksheet containing a chasm trap or on base tables that are related over a chasm trap.
-  Use[Rule-Based Row Level Security]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/data-security/row-level-security.html#).

### Behavior

The following behavior is different for chasm traps than for schemas that do not contain a chasm trap:

-   There are no headlines (single facts based on the data) shown when a search contains a worksheet containing a chasm trap or base tables that are related over a chasm trap.
-   Join information in **What am I Looking At?** does not appear for searches on a worksheet containing a chasm trap or on base tables that are related over a chasm trap.
-   There are cases when attempting to configure certain charts on chasm trap worksheets or tables will not work. If this happens, you will see the error **Your search needs to have unique y-axis values for each series of data shown on the x-axis**. The workaround is to remove all columns from the search, except for those used in your chart.

###  Workarounds

In some cases, there is a workaround of saving an answer as a worksheet (Aggregated Worksheet). See the ThoughtSpot User Guide for details on how to do this. If you save a chasm trap search as a worksheet, it becomes a materialized view of the answer. Effectively, it is then just a regular table (no chasm trap). As such, most of the issues above will not affect searches on the saved worksheet.
