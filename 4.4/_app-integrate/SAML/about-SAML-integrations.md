ThoughtSpot can be set up with Security Assertion Markup Language \(SAML\) to enable Single Sign On \(SSO\). SAML can be configured in several ways, including with CA SiteMinder.

For basic instructions on configuring SAML, use one of these procedures:

-   [Configure SAML for SSO](ts-as-sp.html), for instructions to configure SAML in ThoughtSpot.
-   [Configure SAML with CA SiteMinder](configure-SAML-siteminder.html#), for configuring SAML specifically with CA SiteMinder.
