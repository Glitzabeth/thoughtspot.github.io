# About Microsoft SSIS

Microsoft SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services) is a data integration and workflow applications platform that can be used to connect to ThoughtSpot. The platform is a component of the Microsoft SQL Server database software.

SSIS can be used to perform data migration tasks, and its data warehousing tool can be used for data ETL (extraction, transformation, and loading).

The SSIS Import/Export Wizard creates packages that transfers data with no transformations. It can move data from a variety of source types to a variety of destination types, including text files and other SQL Server instances.

Use SSIS to set up the ODBC Driver by creating a connection manager. This manager is used to create a connection between your OLE DB Source and the ODBC Destination.
