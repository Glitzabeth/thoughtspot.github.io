You can use the Pentaho Data Integration (PDI) to create a JDBC connection. The Pentaho Data Integration (PDI) suite is a comprehensive data integration and business analytics platform. You can use it to create a JDBC connection to ThoughtSpot.

PDI consists of a core data integration (ETL) engine and GUI applications that allow you to define data integration jobs and transformations. Through Pentaho, we primarily use the JDBC driver to set up a connection. The process is not as complicated as with SSIS, and is much more lenient.

Community and enterprise editions of PDI are available. Using the community edition is sufficient, though you may use the enterprise edition, which is subscription based, and therefore contains extra features and provides technical support.
