ThoughtSpot provides certified clients to help you load data easily from your ETL tool or another database. These include ODBC and JDBC drivers.

You can obtain the ThoughtSpot client downloads from the Help Center. Always use the version of the ThoughtSpot clients that corresponds with the version of ThoughtSpot that you are running. When upgrading, make sure to upgrade your clients as well.

{% include important.html content="The ETL tool must add a data transformation step if the source column data type does not exactly match the target's, ThoughtSpot's, column data type. The driver does not do any implicit conversions." %}
