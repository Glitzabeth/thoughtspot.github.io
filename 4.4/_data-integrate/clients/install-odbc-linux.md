It is important to note the following about the ODBC login information:

-   Database username: This is not the machine login username.This is the name of a ThoughtSpot user with administrator permissions.
-   Database password: This is not the machine login password. This is the ThoughtSpot user password.

When you are ready, do the following to install the driver:

1. Create a file on your Linux workstation called /etc/simbaclient.ini and add the following text to it:

    ```
    [Driver]
    ErrorMessagesPath=<path_to_error_messages_directory>
    ```

2. Obtain the ODBC driver:
    1. Navigate to the Downloads page in the Help Center to download the ODBC driver.
    2. Click **ODBC Driver for Linux** to download the file `ThoughtSpot_linux_odbc_<version>.tar.gz`.
    3. Unzip and untar the file:

        ```
        gunzip ThoughtSpot_linux_odbc_<version>.tar.gz

        tar -xvf ThoughtSpot_linux_odbc_<version>.tar
        ```

3. Copy the library files from the Lib directory to a safe location on your Linux machine and add the corresponding path to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable.

    For 32-bit users, the library files are located in the directory:

    ```
    /linux/Lib/Linux_x86
    ```

    For 64-bit users, the library is located at:

    ```
    /linux/Lib/Linux_x8664
    ```

4. Open the file `/linux/Setup/odbc.ini` in the editor of your choice.
5. Find the section for the type of Linux you are using (32-bit or 64-bit), by looking at the `Description`.
6. Find the line below it that begins with `ServerList` and replace 127.0.0.1 with a comma separated list of the IP addresses of each node on the ThoughtSpot instance.

    Leave the port number as 12345. The syntax for `ServerList` is:

    ```
    ServerList = <node1_IP> 12345, <node2_IP> 12345 [, <node3_IP> 12345, ...]
    ```

    For example, for the 64-bit ODBC driver:

    ```
    [ThoughtSpot]
    Description = ThoughtSpot 64-bit ODBC Driver
    Driver = ThoughtSpot
    **ServerList = 192.168.2.249 12345, 192.168.2.148 12345, 192.168.2.247 12345**
    Locale = en-US
    ErrorMessagesPath = /usr/local/scaligent/toolchain/local/simba/odbc/linux/ErrorMessages
    UseSsl = 0
    #SSLCertFile = # Set the SSL certificate file path. The certificate file can be obtained by extracting the SDK tarball
    #LogLevel = 0 # Set log level to enable debug logging
    #LogPath = # Set the debug log files path
    DATABASE = # Set the default database to connect to
    SCHEMA = # Set the default schema to connect to
    ```

    If you need to obtain the IP addresses of the nodes in the cluster, you can run the command `tscli node ls` from the Linux shell on the ThoughtSpot instance.

6. Open the file `/linux/Setup/odbcinst.ini` in the editor of your choice.
7. Update the line that starts with `Driver` to have the path to the file `libSimbaClient.so`

    Use the path where you copied the library files. For example, for the 64-bit ODBC driver:

    ```
    [ThoughtSpot(x64)]
    APILevel            = 1
    ConnectFunctions    = YYY
    Description         = ThoughtSpot 64bit ODBC driver
    **Driver              = /usr/local/scaligent/toolchain/local/simba/odbc/linux/Bin/Linux_x8664/libSimbaClient.so
    **DriverODBCVer       = 03.52
    SQLLevel            = 1
    ```

8. Save the file. Now you can test your ODBC connection.
