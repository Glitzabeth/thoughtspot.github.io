This procedure walks you through creating a worksheet from a search. To create a worksheet from a search (i.e. an aggregated worksheet):

1. Start a new search, or edit an existing visualization from a pinboard.

    Any filters or aggregations created during this search will be reflected in the worksheet.

2. If you want to use a different aggregation than the default one for any column, set it from the column header.

     ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/aggregation_change.png "Select an aggregation")

3. Save the answer as a **Worksheet**.
