With SpotIQ insight feedback, you can rate an insight by clicking the like or dislike icon associated with the insight. When you click dislike, you can provide more details on why you disliked the insight by answering questions. Questions are generated based on the type of insight, and decisions made by SpotIQ during analysis, like attributes or measures chosen for correlation, or aggregation.

Questions are generated based on the type of insight. Decisions made by SpotIQ during analysis, like attributes chosen for drill down or measures chosen for correlation and decisions made by the system on bucketization or aggregation.
Questions determine if the features of an insight are not relevant for the user or too obvious.

On the SpotIQ feedback tab, you can see all SpotIQ feedback you have given. Insights that you disliked are pushed to the bottom of the list.
