With SpotIQ insight feedback, you can rate an insight by clicking the like ![more options menu icon]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/thumb_up.png){: .inline} or dislike ![more options menu icon]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/thumb_down.png){: .inline} icon of the insight.

When you click dislike, you can provide more details on why you disliked the insight by answering questions. Questions are generated based on the type of insight, decisions made by SpotIQ during analysis, or aggregation. The questions help determine if the features of an insight are either not relevant, or too obvious.
