Now that you've enabled ThoughtSpot Embrace, you will be able to add a new connection to a supported database source. Database sources are the external source systems to which you want to perform a live query to create answers and pinboards, without having to bring data into ThoughtSpot.

{% include note.html content="This release only supports Snowflake connection. In coming releases, we shall bring in support for more  relational database sources, like Amazon Redshift, SQL Server, or applications, like Marketo or Salesforce and so on." %}

## Create a new connection

To add a new connection:

1. Log in to ThoughtSpot from a browser.

2. Click **Data** on the top navigation bar.

3. Click the **Connections** tab at the top of the page, and select **+ Add connection** on the upper right hand side of the panel.

4. Select connection type you wish to use from the available list in the Connection Type screen and click **Next**.

     ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/select-new-connection.png "Select a new connection type")

5. Enter the connection credentials to your external data source in the Set Credentials screen and click **Next**:

    Refer to the [Embrace connectors]({{ site.baseurl }}/data-integrate/embrace/reference/embrace-connection-credentials.html#) for more information on each of the specific attributes you must enter into the dialog box.

6. Choose the tables and select the columns you wish to load in the Select Tables screen.
7. When all the columns are selected, click  **Create connection**.

Your connection details appear on the Connections list page. You can select a connection to review the selected tables and columns. Review and edit the table and create schema joins as necessary.

## Data syncing
After youâ€™ve set up an external database connection, you can directly perform a live query against the selected tables mapped in the new connection. This process may take sometime to render the search results since ThoughtSpot doesn't cache the data when you connect to external databases.

To improve the search performance time, Embrace allows you to manage your new data sources using the `Sync` functionality. Using this procedure, you can locally store the selected tables or columns in ThoughtSpot that you wish to use in your search query. You can also schedule some useful conditions when you sync tables from the underlying database periodically. For example, add sync mode to define the data to be replaced or appended with every sync interval.

To sync a data table:
1. Log in to ThoughtSpot from a browser.
2. Click Data on the top navigation bar.
3. Click the Connections tab at the top of the page.
4. Select the connection type of interest on Connections list page.

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/select-connection.png "Select a connection")

5. Find the table you want to sync in the list, and check the box next to its name.
6. Click the **Sync now** icon.

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/sync.png "Table sync")

Notice the sync status in the table list once the sync job completes the syncing request.
