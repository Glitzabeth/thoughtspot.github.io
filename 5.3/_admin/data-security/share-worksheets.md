When you share a worksheet, all of its columns are shared. Sharing a worksheet does not share the underlying tables. If you want to share the underlying tables, see [Share tables and columns](share-source-tables.html#). A worksheet can be shared by the owner of the worksheet, or by an administrator. Users can start searching a worksheet as soon as the worksheet is shared with them.

To share a pinboard:

1. Click **Data** on the top navigation bar and choose **Worksheets**.

2. Select one or more worksheets to share, and click the **Share** icon.

4. Configure the level of access by selecting from the dropdown list. You can select:
    -   **Can View** to provide read-only access. Enables viewing the worksheet and searching on it.
    -   **Can Edit** to allow modification. Enables renaming, modifying filters, or deleting the worksheet and adding or removing its columns. To add columns to a worksheet a user needs access to the underlying table.
5. Click **Add and Save**.
6. Click **Done**.
