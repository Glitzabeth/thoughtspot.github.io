## What's in the Release Notes

ThoughtSpot version 5.2 is now available. These release notes include information about new features,
fixed issues from the previous releases, and any known issues.

* [5.2 New Features](#52-new)
* [5.2 Fixed Issues](#52-fixed)
* [Notes for older versions](#notes-for-older-versions)

## Supported Upgrade Paths

If you are running one of the following versions, you can upgrade to the 5.2 release
directly:

* 5.0.x to 5.2
* 5.1.x to 5.2

(This includes any hotfixes or customer patches on these branches.)

If you are running a different version, you must do a multiple pass upgrade.
First, upgrade to one of the above versions, and then to the 5.2 release.
