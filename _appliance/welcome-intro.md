You can install a ThoughtSpot cluster on a hardware appliance, cloud service, or VMware appliance.
Your ThoughtSpot installation cannot mix node types. For example, you can have either hardware or VMware nodes, but not both. You can, however, have a cloud cluster for development and use an appliance for production.

This guide instructs you how to prepare each of the following:

- [Hardware appliance]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/hardware/inthebox.html)
- [Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/aws/about-aws.html)
- [Microsoft Azure]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/azure/about-azure.html)
- [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/gcp/about-gcp.html)
- [VMware]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/vmware/vmware-intro.html)

After you configure your nodes, you can contact [ThoughtSpot
Support]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/contact.html) by phone, mail, email, or by filing a support ticket.
