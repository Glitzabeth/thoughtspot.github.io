You can install a ThoughtSpot cluster
on a hardware appliance or on a hosted AWS or VMWare appliance. All ThoughtSpot nodes need to be on the same platform and same subnet with no connectivity blocked between any two nodes. You can have multiple clusters on multiple platforms, but you cannot host one cluster on multiple platforms.

This guide instructs you how to prepare each of the following:

- [Hardware appliance]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/hardware/inthebox.html)
- [Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 node]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/aws/about-aws.html)
- [Azure node]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/azure/about-azure.html)
- [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) node]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/gcp/about-gcp.html)
- [VMWare node]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/vmware/vmware-intro.html)

Once you've configured your nodes, you can contact [ThoughtSpot
Support]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/contact.html) by phone, mail, email, or by filing a support ticket.
