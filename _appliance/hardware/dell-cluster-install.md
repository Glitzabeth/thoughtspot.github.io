## Prerequisites
Before you can install your ThoughtSpot clusters on Dell, ensure that you have completed the prerequisite steps: [Configure ThoughtSpot Nodes on your Dell Appliance]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/hardware/installing-dell.html).

## Install ThoughtSpot Software
Install the cluster using the release tarball. The estimated installation time is one hour. Follow the steps in this checklist.

Refer to your welcome letter from ThoughtSpot to find the link to download the release tarball. If you do not have a link, open a support ticket at [ThoughtSpot Support](https://support.thoughtspot.com) to request access to the release tarball.

### Step 1: Run the installer
1. Copy the downloaded release tarball to `/home/admin` using the following command:
```
    $ scp <release-number>.tar.gz admin@<hostname>:/home/admin/<file-name>
```
Note the following parameters:
* `release-number` is the release number of your ThoughtSpot instance, such as 5.3, 6.0, and so on.
* `hostname` is your specific hostname.
* `file-name` is the name of the tarball file on your local computer.

2. Create the cluster.<br>
Run `tscli cluster create` to create the cluster.
```
    $ tscli cluster create <release-number>.tar.gz
```

3. Edit the output with your specific cluster information.<br>
For more information on this process, refer to [Using the `cluster create` command]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/hardware/cluster%20create.html) and [Parameters of the `cluster create` command]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/hardware/parameters-cluster-create.html).

  The cluster installer automatically reboots all the nodes after a successful install. At this time, the system is rebooting, which may take approximately 15 minutes.<br>
  Log into any node to check the current cluster status:
  ```
    $ tscli cluster status
  ```

{: id="cluster-step-2"}
### Step 2: Check cluster health
After the cluster installs, check its status using the `tscli cluster status` command.

Your output may look similar to the following:
```
$ tscli cluster status
Cluster: RUNNING
Cluster name    : thoughtspot
Cluster id      : 1234X11111
Number of nodes : 3
Release         : 6.0

```

### Step 3: Finalize installation

After the cluster status changes to `READY`, sign into ThoughtSpot on your browser.
Follow these steps:

1. Start a browser from your computer.
2. Enter your secure IP information on the address line.
    ```
    https://<IP-address>
    ```
3. If you don't have a security certificate for ThoughtSpot, you must bypass the security warning:
  * Click **Advanced**
  * Click **Proceed**
4. The ThoughtSpot sign-in page appears.
5. In the [ThoughtSpot sign-in window]({{ site.baseurl }}#ts-login), enter admin credentials, and click **Sign in**.
  ThoughtSpot recommends changing the default admin password.
