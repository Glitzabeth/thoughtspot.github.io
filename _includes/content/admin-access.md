Both the `admin` and `thoughtspot` user can SSH into the appliance. Once on the
appliance, either user can do any of the following:

* [tscli]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/tscli-command-ref.html)
* [tql]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/sql-cli-commands.html)
* [tsload]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/loading/use-data-importer.html)


The `thoughtspot` user is restricted to `tscli` commands that do not require
`sudo` or root privileges.
