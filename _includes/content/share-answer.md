Whenever you view an answer, you have the option of sharing it with others. The answer appears in its most recent state when you share it. For example, if you add a filter after saving the answer and then share it, the answer you share has that filter.
1. Configure the answer to look exactly like it must appear when shared.
2. Save the answer by clicking the ellipsis icon ![more options menu icon]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-ellipses.png){: .inline}, and selecting **Save**.

4.  Click the plus (**+**) at the bottom of the Share dialog and select users or groups with whom you want to share this answer.
5. Configure the level of access by selecting from the drop-down list. You can select:
    -   **Can View** to provide read-only access. If the user doesn't have access to the underlying worksheet, they can only view the shared answer.
    -   **Can Edit** to allow modification. Enables renaming or deleting the shared answer. If a user with edit privileges modifies a shared answer, their changes will be saved to it.
