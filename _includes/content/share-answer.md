Whenever you view an answer, you have the option of sharing it with others. The answer appears in its most recent state when you share it. For example, if you add a filter after saving the answer and then share it, the answer you share has that filter.

Follow these steps to share an answer.

1. Configure the answer to look exactly like it must appear when you share it.
2. Save the answer by clicking the ellipsis icon ![more options menu icon]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-ellipses.png){: .inline}, and selecting **Save**.

    ![Click the ellipsis icon and then click save to save an answer.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/sharing-save-answer.png "Click the ellipsis icon and then click save to save an answer.")

3. Share the answer by clicking the sharing icon ![sharing icon]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-share copy-20px.png){: .inline}.

4. If you did not save the answer, ThoughtSpot prompts you to name and save the answer before sharing it.

    ![Save the answer and share it.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/sharing-saveandshare.png "Save the answer and share it. You can add an optional description.")

5. The sharing modal window appears.

4. Enter users or groups with whom you want to share this answer in the text box under **Share**.

    ![Enter users or groups]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/sharing-textbox.png "Enter users or groups to share your answer.")

    Note that you can only enter whitelisted email addresses. Whitelisted email domains appear when you click on the info button ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-info.png){: .inline}.

5. Configure the level of access by selecting from the drop-down list. You can select:
    -   **Can View** to provide read-only access. If the user doesn't have access to the underlying worksheet, they can only view the shared answer.
    -   **Can Edit** to allow modification. Enables renaming or deleting the shared answer. If a user with edit privileges modifies a shared answer, their changes will be saved to it.

    If the selected group or user does not have access to the underlying data, you must enable access to the worksheet, view, or table. A yellow warning symbol appears ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-warning-yellow-20px.png){: .inline}. If you click on it, it tells you to enable access:
