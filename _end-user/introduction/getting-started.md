The **Getting Started** sidebar guides new users through ThoughtSpot with a brief lesson on navigation and several quick videos on ThoughtSpot's main features.

## How it works
When you sign into ThoughtSpot, the **Getting Started** menu appears on the right side of the page. It looks like this:
![The Getting Started menu is on the right side of the page.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/gettingstarted-main.png "The Getting Started menu is on the right side of the page.")

You can click on the menu and open it to see the **Learning Resources** available to you:

Click on the menu options in order to get an overview of ThoughtSpot.

### Navigation overview

1. The **Search** tab
