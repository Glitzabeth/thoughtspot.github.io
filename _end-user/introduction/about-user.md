## SpotIQ preferences and email notifications

You can specify email notifications behavior along with exclude parameters and
threshold settings used for your SpotIQ analyses.

You can change your [SpotIQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/spotiq/overview.html) basic
preferences by checking or unchecking the email and exclude preferences for analyses.

 Click **Insight Threshold Settings** to further refine parameters SpotIQ will use.

 These parameters and threshold settings are a subset of those available on the

 If you set them here, the settings will persist for all your SpotIQ analyses including
 when you run custom analyses, unless you explicitly reset options for a custom analysis.
