## Using Explore

1. In an answer within a pinboard, click **Explore**.

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/explore-01.png "Click Explore")

2. A new visualization appears in the pinboard, with an attached **Explore this data** interface.

3. In interface, you have several available options, grouped under **Try these filters** and **Try these actions**.  

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/explore-02.png "Explore options")

4. Click **More Options** in the filter section, and notice the new suggested filters.  

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/explore-03.png "More filter options in Explore")

5. Click on one of the filters. Here, we choose the filter _Department footwear_.  

   As you select new options, the visualization changes to reflect new filters and actions, and some filters and actions may no longer be possible.  Notice that the _Department footwear_ filter appears on the top left side of the visualization.  

      ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/explore-04.png "Filter on Department footwear")

6. Note the **Explore** action types include the following:  

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/explore-05.png "Explore actions")

    <table>
      <tr>
       <th>Legend</th>
       <th>Action</th></tr>
      <tr>
       <td>1.</td>
       <td>Look at data for different filters, including search for filters </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
       <td>2.</td>
       <td>Change or replace one measurement with another measurement</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
       <td>3.</td>
       <td>Compare one measurement to another measurement</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
       <td>4.</td>
       <td>Compare two values</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
       <td>5.</td>
       <td>Add a breakdown</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
       <td>6.</td>
       <td>Change a breakdown (not shown here)</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

7. To add an action, such as _Break by Store Name_ suggestion, click on that option.

8. The new visualization makes it very clear what stores produced the highest sales for the measurements identified in the active filter.  

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/explore-06.png "Explore footwear sales by store").

9. As you proceed to incrementally change filters take other actions to change the visual. You can add the visualization to your pinboard, remove some or all of the filters, reset to original state, download, and so on.
