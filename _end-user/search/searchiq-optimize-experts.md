***SearchIQ is in Beta.***

While not completely necessary, we recommend that you add Experts to the datasource. These people in your organization know a great deal about the data, and can help you train SearchIQ. They are also the individuals who can assist business users in validating the answers they receive as a result of both regular Search and SearchIQ. You can learn more about that by reading about our [Ask an expert]({{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/search/ask-an-expert.html) feature.

To specify the experts for the datasource, follow these steps:

1. Click the ellipsis icon at the top right corner, and select **Manage Experts**.
