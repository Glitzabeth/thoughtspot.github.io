At times you may struggle to answer a specific question, build a chart you have in mind, or find some piece of information in your data. You can use **Ask an expert** to request help from someone in your organization. Your request will go to the people in your company who best know the available data and how to search it in ThoughtSpot. When your request is answered, you can see the result in the **Answers** listing in ThoughtSpot.

This feature helps in a few ways:

1. You can get an answer to your tough question, even when you get stuck.
2. The expert gets to see what people have trouble finding, so he or she can make it easier.
3. You learn how specific answers are created.

## How do I use Ask an expert?

When you're doing a search, you'll see a link under your search that says **Ask an expert**. Click that if you're stuck and need help.

Your search is captured and shown back to you, with a text box. Type what you were looking for in the box, along with any information that might make it easy for the expert to understand what problem you were having.

An example would be:

I'm having trouble getting this search to show as a stacked column, with each department shown as a separate color.

Then click **Send**.

## What kinds of things can I ask?

You can use **Ask an expert** to ask any kind of question you like. Even if your question is about some data that isn't in ThoughtSpot at all, the expert may be able to help, so it's  always worth asking.
