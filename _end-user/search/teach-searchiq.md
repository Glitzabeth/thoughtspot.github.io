Sometimes the results from SearchIQ won't be quite what you were expecting. You can easily teach SearchIQ your language as you use it. Over time, it gets smarter about how to interpret terms that donâ€™t come directly from keywords, column names, or data values.

## Teach SearchIQ your Language

To teach SearchIQ your language:

1. After receiving a search result from SearchIQ, you'll notice a section below the search bar that shows the SearchIQ interpretation of what you typed or spoke. If you do not see this, click **Refine your query**.

   Wherever you see **- -**, those terms were ignored. Where you see a word or words, those are the keywords, column names, or data values as understood by SearchIQ.

   Clicking on any term brings up the menu where you can change how ThoughtSpot understands that term.

2. Click any term you want SearchIQ to ignore in the future, and choose **Ignore**.

3. Click any term you wish SearchIQ had interpreted differently, and choose **Teach**.

4. When you see the teaching dialog box, 1) use the handles on the search diagram to select a term for which you want to change the mapping. Then 2) select a column name to map it to, or type your mapping in the search bar below the diagram. 3) You may need to select what you mean from the search suggestions.

5. Choose **CONFIRM** to see the new search result.

6. Repeat these steps until SearchIQ understands how to interpret your search.

   SearchIQ will remember what you taught it, and use that to understand your searches in the future.

## What if I teach SearchIQ a different language from somebody else?

SearchIQ learns the language you teach it, and your efforts are useful to everyone else who uses SearchIQ in the future. If SearchIQ learns different search term mappings from different users, these are applied to new searches in a hierarchical fashion, with the top learnings carrying more weight than those further down the list.

The hierarchy of SearchIQ language learning is set up like this:

1. Language mappings the user taught SearchIQ
2. Language mappings the user's [Group members]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/users-groups/about-users-groups.html) taught SearchIQ
3. [Language mappings set by the administrator]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/data-modeling/searchiq-mappings.html)

In this way, SearchIQ provides the best and most customized search experience possible for all users, and your efforts to teach it are valuable to as many people as possible.
