If you upload a spreadsheet, you can share **Can View** or **Can Edit**
privileges with other people, who can further share them with others.

## Understand data sharing

Data that you uploaded from a Web browser is only visible to you and to the
administrator. You can share the entire uploaded table, or only some of its
columns.

By default, if you share only some table columns, users with access to those
columns cannot see the other column's data in their searches. However, the data
can become visible if a worksheet or pinboard that _also contain_ those columns
is shared with these users.

If you want to prevent shares of these types from also revealing the columns,
you can ask your administrator to enable a stricter behavior.


## How to share data

Share uploaded data by following these steps:

1. Click **Data** on the top navigation bar.

2. Click the name of the uploaded data you want to share.

3. Click the **Share** icon.

5. If you selected **Specific Columns**, select the column(s) to share.

6. Click **+** and select the users and groups with whom you want to share.

7. Configure the level of access by selecting from the dropdown list. You can select:
    -   **Can View** to provide read-only access. This enables viewing the table data and defining worksheets on the table.
    -   **Can Edit** to allow modification. This enables renaming, modifying, or deleting the entire table and adding or removing its columns.

8. Click **Add**.

9. Click **Done**.
