You can download a pinboard in PDF format, without downloading each visualization separately.

To download a pinboard in PDF format, follow these steps:

1. Click **Pinboards** on the top navigation bar.

2. Select a pinboard from the list of pinboards by clicking on its title.

3. In the open pinboard, click the **More Options** menu ![more options menu icon]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-ellipses.png){: .inline} (ellipses icon), and select **Download as PDF**.

4. In the **Export pinboard** window, you have two main output options.
  * Select **Pinboard** to generate a PDF that combines several visual answers on the same page, just like they appear on the pinboard.
  * Select  **Visualizations** to print each visualization on its own page of the PDF file.

  5. Select either the **Landscape** or **Portrait** page orientation.

  6. Click **Export**.

  7. After the download completes, examine your PDF.

  Notice that the PDF produced in **Pinboard** mode combines the visuals on the page in the same manner as the original pinboard. Contrast this with the PDF produced in **Visualizations** mode: this PDF combines the small adjacent indicator and KPI visuals at the top, and all other visuals and tables appear on their own page.
