You can download a pinboard in PDF format, without downloading each visualization separately.

This can be very useful for retaining a "snapshot" of a pinboard, because it changes over time as data updates.

To download a pinboard in PDF format, follow these steps:

1. Click **Pinboards** on the top navigation bar.

2. Select a pinboard from the list of pinboards by clicking on its title.

3. In the open pinboard, click the **More Options** menu ![more options menu icon]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-ellipses.png){: .inline} (ellipses icon), and select **Download as PDF**.

4. In the **Export pinboard** window, you have two main output options.
  * Select the **Pinboard** tab to generate a PDF that combines several visual answers on the same page, just like they appear on the pinboard. This composed pinboard option gives a good overview.
  * Select the **Visualizations** tab to print each visualization on its own page of the PDF file. In this manner, you get a more detailed view of each visualization.

  5. Select either the **Landscape** or **Portrait** page orientation.

  6. Click **Export**.

  7. After the download completes, examine your PDF.

  Notice that the PDFs produced in **Pinboard** mode combine the visuals on the page in the same manner as the original pinboard.

  Contrast this with the PDFs produced in **Visualizations** mode.  While this PDF combines the small adjacent indicator and KPI visuals at the top, each of the other visuals and tables appear on their own page.
