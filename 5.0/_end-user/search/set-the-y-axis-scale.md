You can manually set the y-axis range by using the **Edit chart styles** icon.
The style  panel includes the option to manually set the y-axis range. To set
the y-axis range:

1. While viewing your answer as a chart, click **Edit chart styles**.

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/y_axis_range_select_styles.png "Edit chart styles icon")

2. Under **Y-Axis Range** enter your preferred start and end values.

    In this example, our original chart is showing sales values by department
    from 0 to over $10M. We can enter a y-axis range of `5000000` to `1000000` to
    show only sales between $5M and $10M.

    The chart will reorganize itself to reflect the new y-axis range.
