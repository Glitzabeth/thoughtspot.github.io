To do a search using SearchIQ:

1. Click the ThoughtSpot logo to the left of the top menu bar to get to the homepage.

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/top_navigation_bar.png "Menu bar")

   The search bar on the homepage is the SearchIQ-enabled search bar.

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/searchiq_search_bar.png "SearchIQ search bar")   

2. Choose the data you want to search using the selector to the right side of the search bar.

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/searchiq_data_selector.png "SearchIQ data selector")

3. Then click in the search bar and type your search.

   If you see a microphone icon in the search bar, that means your operating system and browser are enabled for speech-to-text. In this case, you can click on the microphone and speak your search instead of typing.

4. Press the **Enter** key when your search is complete.

5. When your answer appears, it will look something like this:
