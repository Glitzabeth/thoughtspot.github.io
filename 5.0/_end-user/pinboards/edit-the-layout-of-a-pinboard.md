Visualizations within a pinboard are easy to move around and snap into place on a relative flow layout. Your pinboard layout is also responsive to your browser resolution. This helps keep the layout of your pinboard neat and organized.

## Reorder the visualization

In addition, the size picker at the bottom of a visualization's three-dot Actions menu lets you toggle between predetermined sizes for each visualization. Charts and graphs can be toggled between a small, medium, and full width size, while headlines can be only one size (small). One row of the pinboard can hold a predetermined number of visualizations of each size.

1. Click **Pinboards**, on the top navigation bar.
