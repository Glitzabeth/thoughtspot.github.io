You can customize the Help menu for your ThoughtSpot application to tailor it to your
organization. When you configure these Help settings, you set system-wide defaults for all your
users.

When your ThoughtSpot users click the Help icon, they see a list of links.

As an administrator, you can add your own links to this list. This allows you to
include documentation specific to your company, such as information about the
data available in ThoughtSpot, where to get support internally, or
company-specific training.

You can also edit existing links, change icons, or remove items from the help listing altogether.
