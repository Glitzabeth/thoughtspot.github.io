You can customize the Help menu for your ThoughtSpot application to tailor it to your
organization. When you configure these Help settings, you set system-wide defaults for all your
users.

When your ThoughtSpot users click the Help icon, they see a list of links.

If a user clicks on the **help** link, the customizable help menu opens:

{% include image.html file="gettingstarted-helpbox.png" title="The customizable help menu" alt="If you click on Help from the help dropdown menu, it opens the customizable help menu, with links to helpful articles, videos, and downloads." caption="The customizable help menu" %}

As an administrator, you can add your own links to this default list. This allows you to
include documentation specific to your company, such as information about the
data available in ThoughtSpot, where to get support internally, or
company-specific training.

To add your own links, select **Admin** from the top menu bar. Then select **Help Customization**. Click on **Add custom menu item**.

You can also edit existing links, change icons, or remove items from the help listing altogether.
