For each unique person who accesses ThoughtSpot, you must create a user account.

You can create users directly in ThoughtSpot, or import users and user groups through LDAP or similar protocols.

When you create a user manually in ThoughtSpot, you continue to manage that user in ThoughtSpot. For example, you can reset the user's password, change their email, and so on. If forgot the admin password, please call [ThoughtSpot Support.]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/misc/contact.html#)

For users who have access through LDAP, the LDAP installation manages all  user information.

## [Create a user through the interface](#create-user-ui)

This procedure demonstrates how to create a user manually. When you create a user, you can assign group memberships. The group's privileges and permissions apply to all of its members. Also, note that all users automatically belong to the group **All**.

1. Log into ThoughtSpot from a browser.
2. Click the **Admin** icon, on the top navigation bar.

6. Click **Add** to create the user.

Note that this process of identifying the user's needs helps setup a robust onboarding process. See [Onboarding users]({{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/onboarding/intro-onboarding.html#)


## Edit or delete a user ##

After a user has been created, you can always go back and change their settings, for example to change their group memberships or change their password. You can also change their name as long as it remains unique

As an administrator, you can edit a user and change the groups the user belongs to. You can also edit a user to reset a userâ€™s password by entering and confirming the new password. This is useful if a user has forgotten their password, or to effectively disable an account.

To edit an existing user:

1. Log into ThoughtSpot from a browser.
2. Click the **Admin** icon, on the top navigation bar.

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/admin_icon.png)

3.  In the **Admin** panel, click **User Management** and **Users**.

     ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/manage_users_3.2.png "Manage Users")

4. Find the user you want to edit in the list and click its name or the edit icon ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/edit_icon.png). If you don't see the name of the user, try searching for it.

    You can also delete a user from this page by clicking the **Delete** icon.

5. Make your changes and click **Save**.
