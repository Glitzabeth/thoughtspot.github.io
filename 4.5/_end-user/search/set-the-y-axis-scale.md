You can manually set the y-axis range by using the **Edit chart configuration** icon. The chart configuration panel includes the option to manually set the y-axis range. To set the y-axis range:

1. While viewing your answer as a chart, click **Edit chart configuration** near the top right.

     ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/edit_chart_configuration.png "Edit chart configuration icon")

2. Under **Y-Axis Range** enter your preferred start and end values.

     ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/y_axis_range.png "Y-Axis Range details")

    Your chart will reorganize itself to reflect the new y-axis range.
