You can see the most granular details of a given result set, i.e. it shows the
un-aggregated view. This feature lets you understand what an answer consists of.
For example, if you search for `customer region revenue`, the answer shows the
aggregate revenue value for each customer region. You can then click on any row
and then on **Show underlying data**, to see each value that `revenue`
constitutes of, for any given region.

Only the first 1,000 rows are shown when viewing the underlying data. You can
even download the results shown when you choose **Show underlying data** from a
chart. The download file limit is a million rows.

{% include note.html content="Viewing underlying data does not work for answers
that are derived from chasm trap searches. Nor does this feature work for pivot
tables." %}

To show underlying data:

1. Right click on the visualization or table cell of interest
