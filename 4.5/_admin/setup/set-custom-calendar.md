By default, the application's fiscal calendar in January. If your company's
calendar year starts in another month, setting a fiscal calendar quarter makes
the ThoughtSpot date searches reflect your fiscal year.

When you set a custom fiscal year, you will designate the month on which your
company's fiscal year begins. All the date language will then reflect your
change, so if someone searches for **this quarter** or **q3**, the answer will
conform to the fiscal quarter in use. When you make this change, existing
pinboards also change to reflect the custom fiscal calendar. Because of this, if
you make this change after your users have been using ThoughtSpot for any period
of time, you should alert them of the change you will be making and how it
affects previous saved searches.

Contact ThoughtSpot Support, so they can help you set the custom fiscal year.
