To make modeling settings for a table you've just loaded, or to make a quick
change to existing settings, use the ThoughtSpot web interface. You can adjust
the **Columns** settings from the data management listing.

You can change all the same data model settings here as in the model file. This
method is easier and faster, unless you need to make many settings in bulk. In
that case, [using the model file](edit-model-file.html#) is recommended.

1. Click on the **DATA** icon, to get to the data management listing.
2. Click on a data source you own or can edit.

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/data_management_select_data_source.png "Select a data source")

    This brings up the **Columns** screen, where you'll make your modeling settings.

3. Modify one or more column settings.

   Descriptions of the possible settings are listed in [Data modeling settings](data-modeling-settings.html#).

4. Save your changes.

5. To check your changes, use the **SEARCH** page to search for across the changed data.
